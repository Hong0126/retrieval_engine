It enables us to advise our clients on ethical risks and upcoming regulatory requirements, and to integrate best practices in our processes and in the design and development of all our AI solutions. Our goal is to maximise the value of AI while identifying and mitigating potential risks."

The first purpose of the Ethics unit is to serve as a “sounding board” to discuss ethically sensitive projects that emerge during the sales process. Given that there is often no “one right answer” to ethical questions, it is important to discuss these cases in a diverse group, taking different perspectives into consideration. This is how the Ethics unit enables ML6 to identify potential ethical risks early on, and define risk mitigation measures to take during design and development of the AI solution."

This includes preparing for and giving feedback on the upcoming EU AI Act and other relevant regulation, researching topics such as bias & fairness, implementing best practices, and creating awareness internally and externally on the topic."

This is strongly aligned with the two purposes of the unit and enables us to take different perspectives and knowledge into account."

Ethical AI needs coordination across different units or departments, with sometimes conflicting incentives. Making sure that your leadership is on board can help overcome potential hurdles.",
                "Focus on the value Ethical AI can bring to your organisation. Trust in and adoption of AI, higher motivation for employees, mitigation of ethical and legal risks — these are just some examples of positive effects implementing ethics structurally in your company can have. Articulate clearly what value Ethical AI can bring to your organisation.",
                "Communicate transparently about ethics. There is often no right answer when it comes to ethics. Having clear processes in place, discussing the topic, and raising awareness might sometimes be even more important than a concrete decision taken.",
                "Define processes together with the people from concerned departments. They know their processes best and need to be committed to the new ways of working. Ask for feedback and actively involve a diverse group of people. Also leverage existing structures as much as possible — modifying existing processes is often easier than inventing new ones."
