These services allow you to create a logo in just a few clicks by selecting text, visual elements and style characteristics. Putting together a logo is generally free but if you want to download a high-quality, vectorized version you have to pay a small sum."

But what if you could have an actual chef to come to your house and cook a unique meal instead? Generative AI models such as OpenAI’s DALL-E 1 and 2 and Google’s Imagen and Parti have shown that they are able to combine and integrate complex concepts and translate them into high quality visual representations, if not indistinguishable from human creativity then closely akin to it. What if we could make a specialized generative AI model to generate truly creative and meaningful logos, not clever combinations of premade elements but as good as the real thing? On top of this, hidden within logos is a common symbolic understanding of the significance and meaning they try to convey (semiotics). Could we get an AI model to comprehend this meaning and not simply create “attractive” logos, but logos which fit with our human expectations and conventions? This blogpost documents the development of a proof-of-concept demonstrator of a DALL-E-like model for generating logos. We discuss data collection, preprocessing, caption generation, model training and results. If you want to jump straight to the interactive demo you can go to Replicate."

Compressed images with a very small file size are most likely to be ‘empty’ or contain large white bands and those with a large file size most likely contain high frequency information, which is typical for real world images.

Techniques used include focal loss, gradient clipping, weight decay and caption variation which are all discussed more in detail below. With this adapted setup we fine-tune the model for 15 epochs until it starts to overfit."

Since we are not directly predicting the full image but rather segments (in the form of image tokens), some tokens occur much more often than others in logos, such as the token that represents a black or white background. These are much more frequent than an exotic image patch with text and multiple colors in it (while the latter is actually more important). So to reduce the effects of these dominant tokens (the safer bets), we implement the Focal Loss. This is an adapted cross entropy loss that puts more weight (in terms of loss) on tokens that are not predicted well (and thus have a lower probability) and reduces the weight of the classes that are already predicted with a decent probability. This shifts the focus of the model from trying to optimize the easier parts even more to actually tackling the harder challenges."

By restricting these weight sizes, by adding the amplitudes of the weights to the loss with the L2 loss, the model weights stay within reasonable bounds and get a better chance of learning features that are widely usable and contain actual useful information that can be used during inference."

Lacking a clear design language (what is “minimal” to you?) and scoring model (a “good” vs. “bad” logo) will comparatively make the learning journey for AI more difficult. Regardless, adding relevant (& tested) classifiers to the existing database, and learning from user input and implicit feedback will be key. Interestingly, if managed well, we believe this might actually drive a new era in making marketing more scientific."
