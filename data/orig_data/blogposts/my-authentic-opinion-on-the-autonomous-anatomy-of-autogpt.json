Therefore, if you are a product owner, a functional analist, or a commercial enthousiast, this should be right up your alley. Happy to read your feedback!"

AutoGPT stands for Autonomous Generative Pre-training Transformer and is an open-source experiment that is drawing a lot of attention at the moment of writing(GitHub link). AutoGPT goes beyond an ordinary chatbot, and its decision-making power reduces the need for human intervention and thus allows for future automation and value creation. Did you skipped a heartbeat when seeing the first possibilities, or did the current missing features made you rather nervous?"

This is fairly easy, and the perceived power of AutoGPT lies in what it does with that starting context. AutoGPT can be seen as an agent that seeks to complete the task autonomously by using a framework that allows it to reason and act. Each task is handled by an ‘Execution Agent’ (GPT-4) and provides input to one or more other GPT-4 agents, which is adding new (sub-)tasks to be completed by the agent. In short, AutoGPT is able to unravel a bigger objective in smaller tasks and mainly act as an orchestrator to achieve the initial objective."

This ‘compounding effect’ of an agent handling a series of tasks by itself is new to us, and is leaving a big impact to the community today."

Today, AutoGPT is still limited by a set of pre-defined commands (of which more will come every day) and its true scale will lie in the number of atomic tasks it supports.Also, these days you quickly experience that AutoGPT can get stuck in a loop, is not able to handle the tasks and thus not able to provide you the expected output."

Over time, we will have a clearer distinction between use cases where AutoGPT is useful (e.g. initial research, composing an itinerary for your next travel destination, …) and where it is not doing a great job at all. For these successful use cases, it will further revolutionise the way we work and interact with machines and the role of humans overall."

However it is still in our hands to provide the possibility to interact with e.g. a rocket via an API. In other words, if we create a way that allows everyone to interact with a rocket launcher, than AutoGPT could learn how to interact with it."

This could encourage the instructor to take action outside of the possibility of AutoGPT. A drastic example to make my point: if you ask AutoGPT to solve a dispute, it could identify that sending a rocket is the best thing to do and that you should do it tomorrow. (Don’t do it!)"

AutoGPT is still quite expensive to run, ends up in infinite loops quite often and is not capable of ‘everything’ (as stated by some online). The genie is out of the bottle but it will take some additional human intelligence to maximise the value of AutoGPT."
