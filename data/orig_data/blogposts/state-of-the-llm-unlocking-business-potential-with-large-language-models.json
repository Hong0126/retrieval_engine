These models, which use artificial intelligence to generate human-like language, have captured public interest like never before, thanks mainly to the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. This explosion of public interest has meant that other companies and groups have followed suit, either by releasing base models like Meta AI’s LLaMA 🦙 or instruction tuning previously released base models like Databricks’ Dolly 🐑 or BAIR’s Koala 🐨."
