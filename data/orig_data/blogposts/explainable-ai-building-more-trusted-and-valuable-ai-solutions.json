However, AI algorithms are still often perceived as “black boxes” — systems for which we can observe the data that flows in and the predictions that come out, but are not able to interpret or explain the inner workings. Explainable AI, also often called XAI, attempts to solve the black box nature of certain machine learning models."

If AI is mature enough to be on par with humans, explainability is about building trust with those who use the model and providing additional useful insights. Consequences of some predictions can be important, for example for a model predicting a malignant tumor. A doctor working with such a model would surely be thinking about the questions: Can I trust that the predictions are right? Why did the model predict this result, and how can I explain it to my patient? With explainable AI, we try to provide the reason why a certain prediction has been made, aiming at building trust and increasing adoption of the ML solution."

We realized quite quickly however that whenever a prediction was not in line with a sales person’s intuition, the recommendation would easily get discarded as not accurate. More explainability was needed in order for users to start trusting the models and actually changing their behaviour. Stay tuned to read how we added explainability in this specific use case later on in this post, and what effects it had."

Our client, a real estate broker, wanted to digitize the process of finding interested tenants for commercial properties — basically creating a recommendation engine for matching businesses with their ideal business space. Together we built an AI solution that could predict which commercial customers would be interested in a certain property — after all, different businesses have different needs: some might prefer being close to a highway, a school or a metro station, others might focus more on size of the property, the availability of parking spaces, or many other possible features. During the solution development, we realized however that for our client, just knowing who was a match didn’t have that much value — it left an important question unanswered: what do I say to my customer why I believe that this specific property is the right one for him? So we switched to an explainable approach, providing also the reasons why there’s a match. This allowed our client to approach their potential customers with very targeted information (“We found a property for you, and believe you could be interested because it is the right size for your company and is located next to a school and office district”). Our client increased the number of contacts tenfold with a response rate of 70%, and became 600% more efficient in servicing their customers."

The predictions, together with the explanations behind the prediction, could then be used to identify the main root causes for underperformance when it occurs, giving us insights into an otherwise too complicated process, and allowing us to reduce the energy output losses."

In this definition, we would be treating the problem as a regression problem. Reframing the problem, we could however turn the solution around, and instead predict the most likely reason the deal will fail (e.g., not the right fit for our company, not enough follow-up actions, etc.).
